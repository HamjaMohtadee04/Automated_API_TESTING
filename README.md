"# Automated_API_TESTING" 
🔍 Automated API Testing | Postman + Newman
Recently, I executed an automated API testing workflow for demo.evershop.io, focusing on validating core e-commerce functionalities such as search, product details, and cart operations.
Using Postman for test design and Newman for CLI-based execution and HTML reporting, I structured the collection to dynamically handle request chaining, data extraction, and assertion logic.
🛠️ What this exercise highlighted:
The value of resilient test scripts in dynamic response scenarios
The importance of clear API response structures for test automation
Practical debugging skills when working with real-world endpoints
This hands-on project was a great opportunity to deepen my QA and automation skills while exploring real API behavior under test conditions.
